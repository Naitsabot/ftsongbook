    Oh the weather outside is frightful \
    But the fire is so delightful \
    And since we've no place to go \
    Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

    It doesn't show signs of stopping \
    And I've bought some corn for popping \
    The lights are turned way down low \
    Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

    When we finally kiss goodnight \
    How I'll hate going out in the storm! \
    But if you'll really hold me tight \
    All the way home I'll be warm

  #vers[
    The fire is slowly dying \
    And, my dear, we're still goodbying \
    But as long as you love me so \
    Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow
