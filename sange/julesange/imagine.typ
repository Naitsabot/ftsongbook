    Imagine there's no heaven \
    It's easy if you try \
    No hell below us \
    Above us only sky \
    Imagine all the people \
    Living for today...

  #vers[
    Imagine there's no countries \
    It isn't hard to do \
    Nothing to kill or die for \
    And no religion too \
    Imagine all the people \
    Living life in peace...

    And the world will be as one_

  #vers[
    Imagine no possessions \
    I wonder if you can \
    No need for greed or hunger \
    A brotherhood of man \
    Imagine all the people \
    Sharing all the world...
