    As I was goin' over Gilgarra Mountain \
    I spied Colonel Farell \
    and his money he was countin' \
    First I drew my pistol \
    and then I drew my rapier \
    sayin' "Stand and deliver \
    for I am your bold deciever"

    He counted out his money \
    and it made a pretty penny \
    I put in my pocket \
    to take home to darlin' Jenny \
    She sighed and swore she loved me \
    and never would decieve me \
    But the devil take the women \
    for they always lie so easy

    I went into me chamber \
    all for to take a slumber \
    To dream of gold and girls \
    and of cource it was no wonder \
    Me Jenny took me charges \
    and she fill'd them up with water \
    Called on Colonel Farell \
    to get ready for the slaughter

    Next mornin' early \
    before I rose for travel \
    A-came a band of footmen \
    an likewise Colonel Farell \
    I goes to draw my pistol \
    for she'd stole away my rapier \
    But I couldn't shoot for water \
    so a prisoner I was taken

    They put me into jail with \
    a judge all a-writin' \
    Robbin' Colonel Farell \
    on Gilgarra Mountain \
    But they didn't take me fists \
    and I knocked the jailer down \
    and bid a farewell  \
    to this tight fisted town

    I'd like to find me brother \
    The one who's in the army \
    I don't know where he's stationed \
    be it Cork or in Killarney \
    Together we'd go roamin' \
    o'er the mountains of Kilkenny \
    And I swear he'd treat me fairer \
    than me darlin' sportin' Jenny

    There's some that takes delight  \
    in the carriages and rollin' \
    Some takes delight \
    in the hurley or the bollin' \
    but I takes delight \
    in the juice of the barley \
    Courtin' pretty maids \
    in the mornin' oh so early
