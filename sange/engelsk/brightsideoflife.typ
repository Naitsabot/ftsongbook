    Some things in life are bad. \
    They can really make you mad. \
    Other things just make you swear and \
    curse.  \

    Life's a piece o' shit \
    when you look at it. \
    Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true. \
    You'll see it's all a show, \
    keep'em laughing as you go. \
